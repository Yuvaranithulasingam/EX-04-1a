# EX-4(A)    LEFT SHIFT OPERATION

## AIM:
 To write a C program to perform the basic right shift operation for 60 integer number with 3 shift.

## ALGORITHM:
1. Start the program.
2. Assign values of a as 44 .
3. Use right shift operator (>>) and shift the value of a three times.
4. Display the result.
5. Stop the program.

## PROGRAM:
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() 
{
    unsigned int a=60 ;	
    int c; 
    c = a>>3;    
    printf("After Right Shift Operation value of a is:%d\n", c );
}
```

## RESULT
Thus the program to perform the basic left shift operation for 44 integer number
with 3 shifts has been executed successfully.
